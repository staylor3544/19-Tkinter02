# In this module, all of the _todo_ items will be in one comment because you
# will be modifying the same block of code as you go.
#
# TODO: 1. (1 pt)
#
#   First, create a tkinter window called window.
#
#   Make sure you call window's mainloop() method so your window will show up
#   when you run this module.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 2. (2 pts)
#
#   Now, create a multiline text entry box called text_box.
#
#   Make sure you use the textbox's pack() method to add it to your window.
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 3. (2 pts)
#
#   Now, use the insert() method to insert text into the multiline text box.
#   You can choose the text that you insert, but you should insert text on
#   multiple lines.
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 4. (2 pts)
#
#   Now, use the get() method to get the text that you inserted. Save that
#   text to a variable and then print that variable.
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 5. (1 pt)
#
#   Now, use the delete() method to delete only the first line of text
#   (leaving the first line as a blank line).
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
